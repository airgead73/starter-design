        <h2>Brainstorm Your Ideas</h2>
        <p>Brainstorming is any form of writing or drawing that allows you to generate ideas. Brainstorming is
          particularly
          useful if you do not have a clear idea of what you want to write. The object is to generate as many ideas as
          possible so that you can find possible directions for your paper.</p>

        <p>Start by <a href="#">writing down the topic</a> you’d like to write about. Then write down any ideas that
          come to mind about
          the
          topic. The quantity of ideas is more important than their quality—the more ideas you come up with, the more
          you have
          to choose from.</p>

        <p>Don’t censor any ideas. Wait until the end of the process to eliminate bad ideas.</p>

        <p>Go ahead and consider wild ideas. You can toss them later if they don’t work, but wild ideas can sometimes
          spark
          creative ideas that will.
          Feel free to combine ideas to come up with new, maybe improved, ideas.After you’ve generated as many ideas as
          you
          can think of, start narrowing them down. Toss those that you think are unworkable, do not interest you, do not
          fit
          well with the other ideas, or will be difficult to cover within the scope of your paper.</p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>You can brainstorm by yourself, with another person, or with a small group of people. Often, others will
          think of
          ideas for your paper that you might not have discovered on your own.</p>

        <p>Save the ideas you brainstormed, even if you don’t use them all. As you write and revise your paper, you may
          find
          you want to use one or two of the ideas you rejected initially. Or if you are stuck in your writing, one of
          your
          rejected ideas may spark more ideas that can help you continue with your paper.</p>

        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <p>There are several online mind-mapping tools that can help you brainstorm, including these free ones:</p>

        <ol role="list">
          <li>With <a href="#">Coggle</a>, you have immediate access to a visual representation of your ideas. If you
            like to
            collaborate, you
            can invite others to contribute to your mind map as you brainstorm.</li>
          <li><a href="#">Popplet</a> creates less artistic but more cleanly designed mind maps. If you like
            organization and dislike
            clutter,
            Popplet may be the best tool for you. This tool works well on mobile devices and tablets.</li>
          <li>
            If you live your life in the <a href="#">Google Cloud</a>, you can download MindMup 2. This tool gets a lot
            of praise from
            users
            because it is simple, intuitive, and easy to learn.
